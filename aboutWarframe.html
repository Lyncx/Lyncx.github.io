	<h4>
		Warframe is an immersive online free-to-play shooter. In this game, you play the role of a savior species, being guided by a strange person known as, "The Lotus", among friends and fellow tenno(the our-world human equivalent). Travel across planets and moons to fight deformed, crude, but surprisingly powerful Grineer, or the high-tech, greedy Corpus merchants. Look out! There's also the infestation, slowly taking over our planets. Quests will have you go deep into the roots of Warframe lore, kill queens, and realize your true form. Not to mention, Warframe's stunning graphics and immersive sound will probably end up crashing your computer! No joke, they're pretty good!
