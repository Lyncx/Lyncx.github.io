			From a small developer, Digital Extremes, Warframe is an immersive online free-to-play shooter. In this game, you play the role of a savior species, the Tenno, being guided by a strange figure known as "The Lotus". Band together with friends in clans and travel across planets &amp; moons to fight deformed, crude, but surprisingly powerful Grineer, or the high-tech, greedy Corpus merchants. The two are the greatest enemies in the Origin System, contantly battling over territory. Look out! There's also the infestation, slowly taking over our planets &amp; killing everything. Explore the open world that is the Plains of Eidolon, fishing, hunting, and gathering. Quests will have you go deep into the roots of Warframe lore, kill queens, and realize your true form. Warframe's stunning graphics and audio will have you playing hours upon hours on end, increasing your collection of warframes and weapons. Customize your arsenal and orbiter with different color palletes, skins, helmets, capes, &amp; more! Then, show off your newly customized items in a game with other players. While you're there, check out the syndicates/factions that you can align yourself with! Warframe just has so much content for you to explore! Go check them out at their website <a href="https://www.warframe.com/" target="_blank" class="wfLink" >here!</a> Ninjas play free!
